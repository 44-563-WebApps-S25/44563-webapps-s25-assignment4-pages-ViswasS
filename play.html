    <h3>Act 1, Scene 1 - An Apartment in the DUKE's Palace</h3>

    <h4 class="name duke">DUKE VINCENTIO</h4>
     <p class="speech">Escalus.</p>

    <h4 class="name escalus">ESCALUS</h4>
        <p class="speech">My lord.</p>

    <h4 class="name duke">DUKE VINCENTIO</h4>
        <P class="speech">Of government the properties to unfold,
        Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
        Since I am put to know that your own science
        Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
        My strength can give you: then no more remains,
        But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,
        And let them work. The nature of our people,
        Our city's institutions, and the terms
        For common justice, you're as pregnant in
        As art and practice hath enriched any
        That we remember. There is our commission,
        From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
        I say, bid come before us Angelo.</P>

        <P class="stage-direction">Exit an Attendant</P>
        
        <P class="speech">What figure of us think you he will bear?
        For you must know, we have with special soul
        Elected him our absence to supply,
        Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
        And given his deputation all the organs
        Of our own power: what think you of it?</P>

        <h4 class="name escalus">ESCALUS</h4>
        <P class="speech">If any in Vienna be of worth
        To undergo such ample grace and honour,
        It is Lord Angelo.</P>

        <h4 class="name duke">DUKE VINCENTIO</h4>
        <P class="speech">Look where he comes.</P>

        <P class="stage-direction">Enter ANGELO</P>
        
        <h4 class="name angelo">ANGELO</h4>
        <P class="speech">Always obedient to your grace's will,
        I come to know your pleasure.</p>

        <H4 class="name duke">DUKE VINCENTIO</H4>
        <p class="speech">Angelo,
        There is a kind of character in thy life,
        That to the observer doth thy history
        Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
        Are not thine own so proper as to waste
        Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
        Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
        Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
        Did not go forth of us, 'there all alike
        As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
        But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
        The smallest scruple of her excellence
        But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
        Herself the glory of a creditor,
        Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
        To one that can my part in him advertise;
        Hold therefore, Angelo:--
        In our remove be thou at full ourself;
        Mortality and mercy in Vienna
        Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
        Though first in question, is thy secondary.
        Take thy commission.</p>

        <H4 class="name angelo">ANGELO</H4>
        <p class="speech">Now, good my lord,
        Let there be some more test made of my metal,
        Before so noble and so great a figure
        Be stamp'd upon it.</p>

        <H4 class="name duke">DUKE VINCENTIO</H4>
        <p class="speech">No more evasion:
        We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
        Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
        Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
        That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
        Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
        As time and our concernings shall importune,
        How it goes with us, and do look to know
        What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;</p>

        <H4 class="name angelo">ANGELO</H4>
        <P class="speech">Yet give leave, my lord,
        That we may bring you something on the way.</p>
